                How was pilates invented?
                <br>
                Pilates takes its name from Joseph Pilates. A German-born emigr√© to Britain and then America, he devised
                the Pilates method as a new approach to exercise and body-conditioning in the early decades of the last
                century.
                <br>
                Pilates was perhaps the first influential figure to combine Western and Eastern ideas about health and
                physical fitness. He researched and practised every kind of exercise he could.
                <br>
                On the outbreak of World War I, the British interned him as a German enemy alien. He used his time as an
                internee to start developing a new approach to exercise and body-conditioning - the start of what is
                known today as Pilates.
                <br>
                During his internment, he also got the chance to work as a nurse. This, in turn, gave him the chance to
                experiment by attaching springs to hospital beds, so that patients could start toning their muscles even
                while they were still bed-bound. Such were the origins of the first Pilates machines now known as the
                Pilates reformer.
