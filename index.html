                    How was pilates invented?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pilates takes its name from Joseph Pilates. A German-born emigr√© to Britain and then America, he
                    devised
                    the Pilates method as a new approach to exercise and body-conditioning in the early decades of the
                    last
                    century.
                    <br>
                    Pilates was perhaps the first influential figure to combine Western and Eastern ideas about health
                    and
                    physical fitness. He researched and practised every kind of exercise he could.
                    <br>
                    On the outbreak of World War I, the British interned him as a German enemy alien. He used his time
                    as an
                    internee to start developing a new approach to exercise and body-conditioning - the start of what is
                    known today as Pilates.
                    <br>
                    During his internment, he also got the chance to work as a nurse. This, in turn, gave him the chance
                    to
                    experiment by attaching springs to hospital beds, so that patients could start toning their muscles
                    even
                    while they were still bed-bound. Such were the origins of the first Pilates machines now known as
                    the
                    Pilates reformer.
